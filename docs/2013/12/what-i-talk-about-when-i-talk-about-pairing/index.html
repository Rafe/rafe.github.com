    <section class="post-content">
      <p>Pair programming, I used to heard a lot about it.<br>Some said, it is fun.<br>Some said, it produce good and clean code.<br>Some said, you can learn from your pair everyday.<br>Therefore, When I have chance to join a pair programming shop. I took the offer without any hestitation.</p>
<p>So after 7 months of pair programming. I thinks it’s a good time to talk about it.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="Pair-programming"><a href="#Pair-programming" class="headerlink" title="Pair programming"></a>Pair programming</h2><blockquote>
<p>Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation.<br>One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in.<br>The two programmers switch roles frequently.</p>
<p>~ from wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pair programming, is one of the most controvesial agile practice.<br>Even most of the company is running agile now, there are not many company take full pair programming pactice.</p>
<p>One of the reason might because pair programming is hard.<br>It requires constantly communicate and discipline between developers.</p>
<p>For example, when your pair is not focus, like he drink too much in the party last night.<br>It will effect the team more than working alone.<br>The result depends on the skillset and communication skill of your pair,<br>sometime it can produce good code and get lots of things done, sometime you would think it is not better than you work alone.<br>So it depends a lot about chemestry among pairs.</p>
<h2 id="How-we-pairs"><a href="#How-we-pairs" class="headerlink" title="How we pairs"></a>How we pairs</h2><p>We work on a 2 27` desktop mac workstation with 2 keyboard and mouse set.<br>with an daily stand up at 9:15, which we usually decide and rotate pair at that time.<br>Then pairing to 5:45 with a cross team standup to share what happened and what we learned today.</p>
<h2 id="Benefits"><a href="#Benefits" class="headerlink" title="Benefits"></a>Benefits</h2><ul>
<li>Constantly review</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, the main difference between pairing and solo is, 80% of your typo will be catched by your pair.<br>Which surprised me when I found so much typo during solo. So debugging is easier too, have a second perspective is helpful<br>in avoid errors, and produce lesser bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher quality</li>
</ul>
<p>On the design side, pairing usually can have more solution than solo.<br>However, the code quality still depends on how good the developers is.<br>We will still produce bad code in pairing. The more experienced developer in pair decide upper limit of the code quality.<br>If a junior developer pair with senior developer, it sure can prevent lousy code.<br>However, when 2 developer have same experience facing a hard problem.<br>The code quality won’t be that different than solo.</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus</li>
</ul>
<p>When pair programming, people can’t surf internet and watch facebook?<br>Thanks for the smart phone, we can still check our facebook and email in pairing.<br>If you don’t care about your pair, You can spend all of your time reading tech news and funny article when working.<br>However, generally is harder to not be focus in pairing than solo,<br>but people can still get distracted by email, internet and meeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing context</li>
</ul>
<p>In pair programming, people share their context between pairs, it also leads to collective code ownership.<br>In our team, we rotate pairs often, also rotate people to other teams. To let context can flow between developers.<br>In 7 months, I rotated in 2 teams, each time I started in a new team.<br>I can easily learn the context from my pairs and be productive.<br>Also for developing features, we rotate the pairs and share the knowledge so every dev can take over the development<br>when someone is off or rotated out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning</li>
</ul>
<p>Pair programming have more chance to learn from your pair.<br>From design skills to shortcut keys, every new pair is the good source to learn new things.<br>We also share things in cross team standup to spread ideas.</p>
<h2 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h2><ul>
<li>Slow</li>
</ul>
<p>Pairing is slow, period. A lot of time, when you have a new pair on working feature.<br>Usually you spend couple of hours to explain the context before you can start to work on it.<br>Also when writing code, you spend time to explain your thought and discuss the implmentation with pair.<br>It is acceptable price to improve quality and share context, but still it slow down the time to finish a feature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Restriction</li>
</ul>
<p>Pairing require some hardware and editor settings, and restrict the time to work and what to work on.<br>You can’t read tech article, write tech blog and test new ideas while pairing.<br>Also, you need to be more disipline and focus on work. (which is good actually)<br>When your pair is sloppy or underperform, you will be effected too.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Pairing is not silver bullet, code is still complex and question is still hard.<br>The quality and speed is actually depends on person more. A good developer can deliver things either pairing or solo.<br>However, pairing is a great way to build team culture and share context.<br>In 7 months of pairing, I learned a lot from my pair, and improve my communication skills to describe technical problems.<br>Most of all, I know better on my coworker because of pairing and like to pair with them.<br>That’s the most important thing for a team isn’t it?</p>
<p>PS. Marshall is awesome (I promised to mention how awesome pair he is in my pair programming article)</p>
