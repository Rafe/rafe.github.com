This is a blog post about my plan in 2016, for the people who think February is too late...
There is still chinese new year so it's totally fine!

In 2016, I plan to improve my coding skill by writing more blog articles and code.

For blog, I am targeting 4 article per month, one of each week.

For code, I want to maintain a daily commit rate, except when I am traveling, It is too tired to write code after snowboarding...
I want to commit on different project for each month. Either private or open source project.

Other than daily commits, I want to focus on 3 new area in 2016:

1. Mobile development
1. Machine learning / Deep learning
1. Virtual Reality / Unity programming

Also, I will like to write a novel in 2016, in case my coding job will be taken by AI.
