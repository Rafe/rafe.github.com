- The myth of 10x engineer
Based on reasearch, some engineer are 10x more productive than others
  - solving fixed problem in limited time
  - productivity is hard to measure
  - ignore team effect, people can ask for help
  - only one side of productivity
  - short term vs long term regression, which will bring people to the mean
    - player play well in one season often play bad next season
  - create toxic traits
    - personal ego, I am more productive
    - work on what he/she want
    - don't like meeting
    - focus on problems rather than team
- the point is don't be the 1x programmer
  - become regression
  - company is not football team
  - no need to compete to become a rockstar
  - don't write bad code
  - don't make mistake
- the most productive programmer
  - be 5x productive and reduce the gap
  - work on team
  - help teammate
  - know team dynamics
  - solve problem at higher level
  - passion on technical problem but know the priority of communication
  - make fewer mistakes
