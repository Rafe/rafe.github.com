Inspiring by [carrierwave](https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave) on Rails.
I wrote a image processing framework to handle images with different versions on node.js and express.
Integrate with node-imagemagick and can upload image to Amazon S3.
It is just a simple version of carrierwave with similiar Api.
But I am comfortable with the features, which is enough for my requirement right now.
I will try to improve the image processing efficiency, and add more processing options for future usage.
