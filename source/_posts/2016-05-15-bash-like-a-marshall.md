Today we are going to reintroduce bash syntax and tools,
some of you might already know, but is still good to review.
In the end of this talk, everyone can write bash script like a marshall.
(or at least understand Marshall's)

This is a talk I gave in my company's learning lunch, the video only have first part because my iphone went out of battery.
But it's still good to share those knowledge about bash.
